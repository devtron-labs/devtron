## ^^^ size estimate, just needs to be non-zero
##
## The .words file is used by gospel (v1.2+), which wraps the Hunspell libraries but populates the dictionary with identifiers from the Go source.
## <https://github.com/kortschak/gospel>
##
## Comment lines are not actually parsed as comments, try to be careful ... but in practice they seem to work?
##
## We assume en_US hunspell dictionaries are installed and used.  The /AFFIXRULES are defined in en_US.aff (eg: /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.aff)
##
## words which are in the base dictionary can't have extra affix rules added to them, so we have to start with the affixed variant we want to add.
##   thus creds rather than cred/S and so on
## So we can't use receive/DRSZGBU, adding 'U', to allow unreceive and variants, we have to use unreceive as the stem.
## We can't define our own affix or compound rules, to capture rfc\d{3,} or 0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}

## Legitimate spellings in non-US English dialects;
## regular-if-rarer words just missing from the dictionary;
## variants of words not covered by hunspell en_US rules.

# I think that retry, being added as a symbol, is precluding the re-addition here with affix rules,
# so "retry/SB" above is ignored

## Things gospel doesn't pick up, but doesn't yet; I've filed <https://github.com/kortschak/gospel/issues/9>
## Eg, plurals of non-collection types, or wire-format encodings in a struct field's tag

ChanSubscriptions

no_wait

## Conceptual nouns not actually in the source, describing state
SlowConsumer

## Symbols from elsewhere referred to in comments but not referenced in the code, so not currently surfaced by gospel as acceptable
