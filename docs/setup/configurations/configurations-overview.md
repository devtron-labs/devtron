# Configurations

You can configure Devtron by using configuration files. Configuration files are YAML files which are user-friendly.
The configuration allows you to quickly roll back a configuration change if necessary. It also aids cluster re-creation and restoration.

There are two ways you can perform configurations while setting up Devtron dashboard:

* [Installation Configurations](setup/configurations/installation-configuration.md)
* [Override COnfigurations](setup/configurations/override-default-devtron-installation-configs.md)


You can also setup `ingress` while setting up Devtron dashboard. Refer [here](setup/configuration/ingress-setup.md) for ingress setup.
