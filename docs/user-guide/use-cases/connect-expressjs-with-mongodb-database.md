# Connect Expressjs With Mongodb Database

## Introduction

In this application, you will learn about how to create a Expressjs Application that connects to mongoDb.

Follow the below-mentioned steps, to deploy the application on Devtron using mongoDb Helm Chart.

## **1. Deploy mongoDb Helm Chart**

To deploy mongoDb Helm Chart, you can refer to our documentation on [Deploy mongoDb Helm Chart](../deploy-chart/examples/deploying-mongodb-helm-chart.md)

## **2. Fork the Git Repository**

For this example, we are using the following [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devtron-labs/DockerNodeMongo), you can clone this repository and make following changes in the files.

### _\*Dockerfile_

This is the Dockerfile. This exposes our expressjs application to port number 8080

```bash
FROM node:7
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
CMD node server.js
EXPOSE 8080
```

### _\*db.js File_

This file will be used to connect to our database. This will include the `service-name` of the mongoDb Helm Chart, that you have deployed in Step1.

The syntax is as follows:

`<service-name>:27017/<database-name>`

This maps our service name to mongoDb's port number 27017.

```bash
module.exports = {
    DB: 'mondo-dev-mongodb-replicaset-client:27017/sale'
}
```

## **3. Create Application on Devtron**

To learn how to create an application on Devtron, refer to our documentation on [Creating Application](../creating-application/)

### _\*Git Repository_

In this example, we are using the url of the forked Git Repository.

### _\*Docker configuration_

Give, the path of the Dockerfile.

### _\*Configure Deployment Template_

Enable `Ingress`, and give the path on which you want to host the application.

### _\*Set up the CI/CD Pipelines_

Set up the CI/CD pipelines. You can set them to trigger automatically or manually.

### _\*Trigger Pipelines_

Trigger the CI Pipeline, build should be **Successful**, then trigger the CD Pipeline, deployment pipeline will be initiated, after some time the status should be **Healthy**

## **4. Final Step**

Check the Expressjs app connected to mongodb database, running successfully by hitting your application url.

The syntax is: `http://<hostname>/<path>/`

_**path**_ will be the one that you have given in Step 3 while configuring the Deployment Template.

The output of our application would be as follows:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/use-case-expressjs-view-demo-data%20%281%29.jpg)

You can see that we are getting the JSON response. We have successfully connected our expressjs application to the mongoDb database.
