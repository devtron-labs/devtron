# Deploying Application

Each time you push a change to your application through GitHub, your application goes through a process to be built and deployed.

There are two main steps for building and deploying applications:

* [Triggering CI](triggering-ci.md)

* [Triggering CD](triggering-cd.md)

You can also rollback the deployment. Refer [Rollback Deployment](rollback-deployment.md) for detail.
