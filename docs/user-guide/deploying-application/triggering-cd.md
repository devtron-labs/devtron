The status of the current deployment can be viewed by Clicking on **App Details** that will show the _Progressing_ state for 1-2 minutes and then gradually shows _Healthy_ state or _Hibernating_ state, based on the deployment strategy.

Here, triggering CD Pipeline is successful and the deployment is in "Healthy" state.
