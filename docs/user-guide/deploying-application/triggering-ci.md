## Triggering CI Pipelines

![](../../.gitbook/assets/trigger-console%20%282%29%20%282%29.jpg)

The CI Pipeline can be triggered by selecting **Select Material**

CI Pipelines that are set as Automatic are always triggered as soon as a new commit is made to the git branch they're sensing. However, CI Pipelines can always be manually triggered as and if required.

Various commits done in the repository can be seen, here along with details like Author, Date etc. Select the commit that you want to trigger and then select "Start Build" to trigger the CI Pipeline.

**Refresh** icon, refreshes Git Commits in the CI Pipeline and fetches the latest commits from the “Repository”

**Ignore Cache** : This option will ignore the previous build cache and create a fresh build. If selected, will take a longer build time than usual.
