On clicking `New Build Pipeline`. Three options appear as mentioned below:

* **Continuous Integration:** Choose this option if you want Devtron to build the image of source code.
* **Linked CI Pipeline:** Choose this option if you want to use an image created by an existing CI pipeline in Devtron.
* **Incoming Webhook:** Choose this if you want to build your image outside Devtron, it will receive a docker image from an external source via the incoming webhook.


Then, Create CI/CD Pipelines for your application.
