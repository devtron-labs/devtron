## Copy Container Image

This plugin copies a container image to a desired container [repository](../../../../reference/glossary.md#repo). The pushing of image can be between repositories of the same container [registry](../../../../reference/glossary.md#containeroci-registry) or between repositories of different container registry.

The plugin can be used at any stage, i.e., pre & post CI, job, pre & post CD. This is especially useful when unique repositories are maintained for production builds (using the same CI pipeline).

## Steps to Use

1. Go to **App Configuration** tab of your application.

2. Select **Workflow Editor** and click your deployment pipeline.

3. In this example, we will be adding the plugin in pre CD stage; therefore, go to **Pre-Deployment stage** tab of your deployment pipeline and click **Add task**.

    * **registry-name** is the name you gave to your container registry while adding it in [Global Configuration â†’ OCI/Container Registry](../../../global-configurations/container-registries.md#add-container-registry).

    * **user-name** is the your account name registered with you container registry, e.g., DockerHub.

    * **repository-name** is the name of the respository within your container registry that hosts the container images of your application.

6. Click **Update Pipeline**.

7. Go to the **Build & Deploy** tab of your application and click **Select Image** in the pre-deployment stage.

9. The copying process will initiate and once it is successful the tag for the copied image would reflect at all relevant screens:

    * **Destination Repository**
