## Automated Test suite integration in the CI step using devtron-ci.yaml

Users can run the test case using the Devtron dashboard or by including the test cases in the devtron.ci.yaml file in the source git repository. For reference, check: [https://github.com/kumarnishant/getting-started-nodejs/blob/master/devtron-ci.yaml](https://github.com/kumarnishant/getting-started-nodejs/blob/master/devtron-ci.yaml)

The test cases given in the script will run before the test cases given in the devtron.ci.yaml
