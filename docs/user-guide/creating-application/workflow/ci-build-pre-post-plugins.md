# Pre-Build and Post-Build Stages

The CI pipeline includes Pre and Post-build steps to validate and introduce checkpoints in the build process.
The pre/post plugins allow you to execute some standard tasks, such as Code analysis, Load testing, Security scanning etc. You can build custom pre-build/post-build tasks or select one of the standard preset plugins provided by Devtron.

Preset plugin is an API resource which you can add within the CI build environment. By integrating the preset plugin in your application, it helps your development cycle to keep track of finding bugs, code duplication, code complexity, load testing, security scanning etc. You can analyze your code easily.

> Devtron CI pipeline includes the following build stages:
>
> * Pre-Build Stage: The tasks in this stage run before the image is built.
> * Build Stage: In this stage, the build is triggered from the source code (container image) that you provide.
> * Post-Build Stage: The tasks in this stage are triggered once the build is complete.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have [CI build pipeline](./ci-pipeline.md) before you start configuring Pre-Build or Post-Build tasks.

## Configuring Pre/Post-build Tasks

Each Pre/Post-build stage is executed as a series of events called tasks and includes custom scripts.
You can create one or more tasks that are dependent on one another for execution. In other words, the output variable of one task can be used as an input for the next task to build a CI runner. The tasks will run following the execution order. 

The tasks can be re-arranged by drag-and-drop; however, the order of passing the variables must be followed.

You can create a task either by selecting one of the available preset plugins or by creating a custom script.

| Stage | Task |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pre-Build/Post-Build | <ol><li>Create a task using one of the [Preset Plugins](#preset-plugins) integrated in Devtron:<ul><li>[K6 Load testing](#k6-load-testing)</li><li>[Sonarqube](#sonarqube)</li><li>[Dependency track for Python](#dependency-track-for-python)</li><li>[Dependency track for NodeJs](#dependency-track-for-nodejs)</li><li>[Dependency track for Maven and Gradle](#dependency-track-for-maven--gradle)</li><li>[Semgrep](#semgrep)</li><li>[Codacy](#codacy)</li></ul></li><li>Create a task from [Execute Custom script](#execute-custom-script) which you can customize your script with:<ul><li>[Custom script - Shell](#custom-script-shell)</li><li>Or, [Custom script - Container image](#custom-script-container-image)</li></ul></li></ol> | 


## Creating Pre/Post-build Tasks

Lets take `Codacy` as an example and configure it in the Pre-Build stage in the CI pipeline for finding bugs, detecting dependency vulnerabilities, and enforcing code standards.

### Execute custom script

1. On the **Edit build pipeline** screen, select the **Pre-build stage**.
2. Select **+ Add task**.
3. Select **Execute custom script**.

The task type of the custom script may be a [Shell](#custom-script---shell) or a [Container image](#custom-script---container-image).

#### Custom script - Shell

* Select the **Task type** as **Shell**.

Consider an example that creates a Shell task to stop the build if the database name is not "mysql". The script takes 2 input variables, one is a global variable (`DOCKER_IAMGE`), and the other is a custom variable (`DB_NAME`) with a value "mysql".
The task triggers only if the database name matches "mysql".
If the trigger condition fails, this Pre-build task will be skipped and the build process will start.
The variable `DB_NAME` is declared as an output variable that will be available as an input variable for the next task.
The task fails if `DB_NAME` is not equal to "mysql".
