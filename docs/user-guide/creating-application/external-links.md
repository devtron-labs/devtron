# External Links

This is similar to [External Links](../global-configurations/external-links.md) present under Global Configurations. 

The only difference is that in **App Configuration** → **External Links**, only the links editable by application admins and manager are displayed. You can also configure external links separately for your application.

Whereas, in **Global Configurations** → **External Links**, you can configure the external links for all applications in a cluster or for specific applications.
