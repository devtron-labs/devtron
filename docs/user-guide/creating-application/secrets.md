# Secrets

Secrets and configmaps both are used to store environment variables but there is only one major difference between them, Configmap stores key-values in normal text format, and secrets store them in base64 encrypted form. Devtron platform hides the data of secrets for the normal users and it is only visible to the users having edit permission.

Secret objects let you store and manage sensitive information, such as- passwords, auth tokens, and ssh keys. Embedding this information in a secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a Pod definition or in a container image.

There are five Data types that you can use to save your secret.

* **Kubernetes Secret**: The secret that you create using Devtron.
* **Kubernetes External Secret**: The secret data of your application is fetched externally, converts the Kubernetes External Secret to Kubernetes Secret. The conversion is completely transparent to Pods and secrets are accessed normally.
* **AWS Secret Manager**: The secret data of your application is fetched from AWS Secret Manager, converts AWS Secret to Kubernetes Secret. The conversion is completely transparent to Pods that can access secrets normally.
* **AWS System Manager**: The secret data for your application is fetched from AWS Secret Manager, converts the secrets stored in AWS System Manager to Kubernetes Secret. The conversion is completely transparent to Pods that can access secrets normally.
* **Hashi Corp Vault**: The secret data for your application is fetched from AWS Secret Manager, converts the secrets stored in Harshi Corp Vault to Kubernetes Secret. The conversion is completely transparent to Pods that can access secrets normally.

## Volume Mount Path

Specify the Volume Mount folder path in `Volume Mount Path`, a path where the data volume needs to be mounted. This volume will be accessible to the Containers running in a pod.
