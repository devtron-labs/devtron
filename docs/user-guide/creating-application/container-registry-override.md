#  Override Build Configuration

Within the same application, you can override a `container registry`, `container image` and `target platform` during the build pipeline, which means the images built for non-production environment can be included to the non-production registry and the images for production environment can be included to the production registry.

To override a container registry, container image or target paltform:

* Go to **Applications** and select your application from the **Devtron Apps** tabs.
* On the **App Configuration** tab, select **Workflow Editor**.
* Open the build pipeline of your application.
* Click **Allow Override** to:
   * Select the new container registry from the drop-down list.
   * Or, [create and build the new container image](https://docs.devtron.ai/usage/applications/creating-application/docker-build-configuration#build-the-container-image) with different options.
   * Or, set a [new target platform](https://docs.devtron.ai/usage/applications/creating-application/docker-build-configuration#set-target-platform-for-the-build) from the drop-down list or enter a new target platform.

* Click **Update Pipeline**.

The overriden container registry/container image location/target platform will be reflected on the [Build Configuration](docker-build-configuration.md) page. You can also see the number of build pipelines for which the container registry/container image location/target platform is overriden.
