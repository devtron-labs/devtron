# Docker Registries

The global configuration helps you add your `Docker Registry`. In the Docker registry, you provide credentials of your registry, where your images will be stored. And this will be shown to you as a drop-down on `Docker Build Config` Page.

## Add Docker Registry configuration:

Go to the `Docker Registry` section of `Global Configuration`. Click on `Add docker registry`.

You will see below the input fields to configure the docker registry.

### Set as default:

If you enable the `Set as default` option, then this registry name will be set as default in the `Docker Registry` section inside the `Docker build config` page. This is optional. You can keep it disabled.

### Advance Registry Url connection options:

* If you enable the `Allow Only Secure Connection` option, then this registry allows only secure connections.

* If you enable the `Allow Secure Connection With CA Certificate` option, then you have to upload/provide private CA certificate (ca.crt).

* If the docker registry is insecure (for eg : SSL certificate is expired), then you enable the `Allow Insecure Connection` option.

Now click on `Save` to save the configuration of the `Docker registry`.
