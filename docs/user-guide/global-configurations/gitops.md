# GitOps

## Introduction

In Devtron, you can either use Helm or GitOps (Argo CD) to deploy your applications and charts. GitOps is a branch of DevOps that focuses on using Git repositories to manage infrastructure and application code deployments.

If you use the GitOps approach, Devtron will store Kubernetes configuration files and the desired state of your applications in Git repositories.

## Steps to Configure GitOps

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
Users need to have super-admin permission to configure GitOps.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to **Global Configurations** â†’ **GitOps**

   ![Figure 1: Global Configuration - GitOps](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/gitops/gitops-v1.jpg)

2. Select any one of the [supported Git providers](#supported-git-providers) to configure GitOps. 

   ![Figure 2: Selecting a Provider](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/gitops/select-provider-v1.jpg)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Git provider you select for configuring GitOps might impact the following sections:
   * [Deployment Template](../creating-application/deployment-template.md)
   * [Charts](../deploy-chart/README.md)
{% endhint %}

3. Fill all the mandatory fields. Refer [supported Git providers](#supported-git-providers) to know more about the respective fields.

   ![Figure 3: Entering Git Credentials](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/gitops/git-fields.jpg)

4. In the **Directory Management in Git** section, you get the following options:

   * **Use default git repository structure**:
   
      This option lets Devtron automatically create a GitOps repository within your organization. The repository name will match your application name, and it cannot be changed. Since Devtron needs admin access to create the repository, ensure the Git credentials you provided in Step 3 have administrator rights.

   * **Allow changing git repository for application**: 
   
      Select this option if you wish to use your own GitOps repo. This is ideal if there are any confidentiality/security concerns that prevent you from giving us admin access. Therefore, the onus is on you to create a GitOps repo with your Git provider, and then [add it to the specific application](../creating-application/gitops-config.md) on Devtron. Make sure the Git credentials you provided in Step 3 have at least read/write access. Choosing this option will unlock a [GitOps Configuration](../creating-application/gitops-config.md) page under the [App Configuration](../creating-application/README.md) tab.

   ![Figure 4: Need for User-defined Git Repo](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/gitops/user-defined-git.jpg)

5. Click **Save**/**Update**. A green tick will appear on the active Git provider.

### Feature Flag

Alternatively, you may use the feature flag **FEATURE_USER_DEFINED_GITOPS_REPO_ENABLE** to enable or disable custom GitOps repo.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For disabling** - `FEATURE_USER_DEFINED_GITOPS_REPO_ENABLE: "false"` <br />
**For enabling** - `FEATURE_USER_DEFINED_GITOPS_REPO_ENABLE: "true"`
{% endhint %}

#### How to Use Feature Flag

![Using Feature Flag](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/gitops/dashboard-cm.gif)

1. Go to [Devtron's Resource Browser](../resource-browser.md).
2. Select the cluster where Devtron is running, i.e., `default_cluster`.
3. Go to the **Config & Storage** dropdown on the left.
4. Click **ConfigMap**.
5. Use the namespace filter (located on the right-hand side) to select `devtroncd` namespace. Therefore, it will show only the ConfigMaps related to Devtron, and filter out the rest.
6. Find the ConfigMap meant for the dashboard of your Devtron instance, i.e., `dashboard-cm` (with an optional suffix).
7. Click **Edit Live Manifest**.
8. Add the feature flag (with the intended boolean value) within the `data` dictionary 
9. Click **Apply Changes**.
