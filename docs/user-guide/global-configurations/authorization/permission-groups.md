# Permission Groups

Using the `Permission groups`, you can assign a user to a particular group and a user inherits all the permissions granted to the group. 

The advantage of the `Permission groups` is to define a set of privileges like create, edit, or delete for the given set of resources that can be shared among the users within the group.

**Note**: The [User permissions](https://docs.devtron.ai/global-configurations/authorization/user-access) section for `Specific permissions` contains a drop-down list of all existing groups for which a user has an access. This is an optional field and more than one groups can be selected for a user.

## Add Group

To add a group, go to the `Authorization > Permissions groups` section of `Global Configurations`. Click **Add group**.

   * [Helm Apps](#helm-apps-permissions)
   * [Kubernetes Resources](#kubernetes-resources-permissions)
   * [Chart Groups](#chart-group-permissions)
