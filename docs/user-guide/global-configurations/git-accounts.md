# Git Accounts

Global configurations are used to configure your Git Providers, Docker Registry, Kubernetes clusters, different environments, User Management, and different Notifications for your application. We have segregated all the configurations and we will discuss how to configure all these one by one.

## Git Account Configuration

### 1. Name

Provide a name to your Git provider. This will be added as one option in the Git Provider drop-down inside the Git Material section.

### 2. URL

Provide the `URL` of your Version Controller. **For example**- github.com for Github, [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) for GitLab, etc.

### 3. Authentication type

Here you have to provide the type of Authentication required by your version controller. We are supporting three types of authentications, you can choose any one from them.

* **Anonymous**

If you select `Anonymous` then you do not have to provide any username, password, and authentication token. Just click on `Save` to save your git account provider details.
