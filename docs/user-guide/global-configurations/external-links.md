# Link to external Monitoring Tools

External links allow you to connect to the third-party Monitoring Tools within your Devtron dashboard for seamlessly debugging your applications.
The Monitoring Tool is available as a bookmark at different component levels, such as application, pods, and container levels.

## Use case

To monitor/debug an application using a specific Monitoring Tool (such as Grafana, Kibana, etc.), you may need to navigate to the tool's page, then to the respective app/resource page.

External links allow you to directly go to the tool's page, which includes the completeÂ context of the app, environment, pod, and container.

    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>
            Choose the Clusters for which you wan to configure the selected tool.
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple Clusters may be selected by checking more than one Cluster name</li>
                <li>All Clusters may be selected, to include the existing Clusters as well as any future Clusters</li>                
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>URL Template</td>
        <td>
            The configured URL Template is used by apps deployed on the selected Clusters.            
            By combining one or more of the env variables, a URL with the structure shown below can be created:<br></br>
            <i>http://www.domain.com/{namespace}/{appName}/details/{appId}/env/{envId}/details/{podName}</i>
            <br></br>
            The env variables:
            <ul>
                <li>{appName}</li>
                <li>{appId}</li>
                <li>{envId}</li>
                <li>{namespace}</li>
                <li>{podName}</li>
                <li>{containerName}</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Note: URL template is dynamically generated from the env variables provided at the time of adding the link.</b><br></br>
            For example:
            <code>https://www.grafana.com/grafana/devtroncd/demo-app/details/24/prod/191/details/my-pod-name</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
