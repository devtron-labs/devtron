# User Access

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqBRIFbuSU" caption="" %}

Like any enterprise product, Devtron supports fine grained access control to the resources based on

1. Type of action allowed on the Devtron resources (Create Vs View)
2. Sensitivity of the data (Editing image Vs Editing memory)

Access can be added to the User either directly or via Groups.

## Role-based Access Levels

Devtron supports 5 levels of access:

1. **View**: User with `view` only access has the least privilege. This user can only view combination of environments, applications and helm charts on which access has been granted to the user. This user cannot view sensitive data like secrets used in applications or charts.
2. **Build and Deploy**: In addition to `view` privilege mentioned in above, user with `build and deploy` permission can build and deploy the image of permitted applications and helm charts to permitted environments.
3. **Admin**: User with `admin` access can create, edit, delete and view permitted applications in permitted projects.
4. **Manager**: User with `manager` access can do everything that an `admin` type user can do, in addition they can also give and revoke access of users for the applications and environments of which they are `manager`.
5. **Super Admin**: User with `super admin` privilege has unrestricted access to all Devtron resources. Super admin can create, modify, delete and view any Devtron resource without any restriction; its like Superman without the weakness of Kryptonite. Super Admin can also add and delete user access across any Devtron resource, add delete git repository credentials, container registry credentials, cluster and environment.

## Email addresses:

In the `Email address` box, you have to provide the mail ID of the user to whom you want to give access to your applications.

**`IMP`** Please note that Email address should be same as that in the `email` field in the JWT token returned by OIDC provider.

### Assign super admin permissions

If you check the option `Assign super admin permissions`, the user will get full access to your system and the rest of the options will disappear. Please check [above](#access-levels) to see permission levels. Only users with super admin permissions can assign super admin permissions to a user.

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/user-access/add-user-2.jpg)

We suggest that super admin privileges should be given to only select few.

If you donâ€™t want to assign super admin permissions then you have to provide the rest of the information.

### Group Permissions

This is used to assign user to a particular group and user inherits all the permissions granted to this group. The Group permissions section contains a drop-down of all existing groups on which you have access. This is optional field and more than one groups can be selected for a user.

We will discuss how to create groups in the later section.

### Chart Group Permissions

You can also manage the access of users to Chart Groups in your project.

After you have done editing the user permissions, click on `Save`.

If you want to delete the user/users with particular permissions, click on `Delete`.

## Groups

The advantage of the groups is to define a set of privileges like create, edit, or delete for the given set of resources that can be shared among the users within the group. Users can be added to an existing group to utilize the privileges that it grants. Any access change to group is reflected immediately in user access.

You can select the group which you are creating in the `Group permissions` section inside `Add users`.

### 1. Add new Group

Go to  `Groups` and click on `Add Group`, to create a new group.

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/user-access/Add+group+permission_dashboard_1.JPG)

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/user-access/group+permission_description_2.JPG)

### 2. Create Group Permissions

Once you have given the group name and group description.

Then, control the access permissions of groups in the Devtron Apps, Helm Apps or Group Chart Permissions section. Manage the Project, Environment, Application, and Role access the same as we discuss in the above users section.

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/user-access/group+permission_devtron+app_3.JPG)

You can add multiple rows, for the Devtron Apps and Helm Apps Permissions section.

Once you have finished assigning the appropriate permissions for the listed users, Click on `Save`.

### 3. Edit Group Permissions

You can edit the group permissions, by clicking on the `downward arrow.`

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/user-access/group+permission_dropdown_4.JPG)

Then you can edit the user permissions here.

Once you are done editing the group permissions. Click on `Save`.

If you want to delete the groups with particular permissions. Click on `Delete`.

### 4. Manage Chart Group Permissions

The chart group permissions for the group will be managed in the same way as for the users. For reference, check Manage chart group permissions for users.
