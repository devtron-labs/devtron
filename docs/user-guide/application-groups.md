# Application Groups

## Introduction

Application groups in Devtron streamline the deployment of microservices by enabling you to build and deploy multiple applications simultaneously. This feature is particularly beneficial when your microservices are interdependent, as a change in one service often triggers the need to redeploy others.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only one application group would exist for each [environment](../reference/glossary.md#environment). You cannot group applications belonging to different environments.
{% endhint %}

---

## Accessing Application Groups

1. From the left sidebar, go to **Application Groups**

    ![Figure 1: Application Group (Beta)](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-group-tab.jpg)

2. You will see a list of environments. Select the environment to view the application group.

    ![Figure 2: List of Environments](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-groups.jpg)

3. The application group would contain the applications meant for deployment in the chosen environment.

    ![Figure 3: Sample Application Group](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-group-overview-1.jpg)

As you can see, it has similar options as available under [Applications](./applications.md):
* Overview
* Build & Deploy
* Build history
* Deployment history
* Configurations

{% hint style="info" %}
Users need to have [View only permission](../user-guide/global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#role-based-access-levels) or above (along with access to the environment and applications) to view all the applications within a group.
{% endhint %}

First, we will walk you through the [key features](#key-features) of Application Groups, followed by [additional features](#additional-features) that will help you perform bulk actions.

## Key Features

### Building Application Images

The **Build & Deploy** tab of your application group enables you to trigger the [CI builds](../reference/glossary.md#image) of one or more applications in bulk.

1. Select the applications using the checkboxes and click the **Build Image** button present at the bottom.

    ![Figure 4: Build Option](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-app.jpg)

2. The `Build image` screen opens. Select the application and the [commit](../reference/glossary.md#commit-hash) for which you want to trigger the CI build.

    ![Figure 5: Selecting Commit](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-commit-1.jpg)

    Repeat the step for other applications, and then click **Start Build**.

    ![Figure 6: Building Images](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-commit-2.jpg)

3. The builds will be initiated, following which, you can close the `Build image` screen.

    ![Figure 7: Triggered Deployment](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/build-image.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Users need to have [Build and deploy permission](../user-guide/global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#role-based-access-levels) or above (along with access to the environment and applications) to trigger the build
{% endhint %}


### Changing Configurations

The **Configurations** tab of your application group allows you to configure the following:

* [Deployment template](../reference/glossary.md#base-deployment-template)
* [ConfigMaps](../reference/glossary.md#configmaps)
* [Secrets](../reference/glossary.md#secrets)

As shown below, you can handle the configurations of more than one application from a single screen.

![Figure 8: Configurations of each App](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/configurations.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Users need to have [Admin role](../user-guide/global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#role-based-access-levels) or above (along with access to the environment and applications) to change their configuration. Please note, you might not be able to change the values of locked keys in deployment template. Refer [Lock Deployment Configuration](./global-configurations/lock-deployment-config.md) to know more.
{% endhint %}


### Deploying Applications

The **Build & Deploy** tab of your application group helps you deploy one or more applications in bulk.

1. Select the applications using the checkboxes and click the **Deploy** button present at the bottom.

    ![Figure 9: Deploy Option](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-app-deploy.jpg)

2. Select the desired container image that you want to deploy for respective application.

    ![Figure 10: Selecting Image](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-image-1.jpg)

    Repeat the step for other applications too, and then click **Deploy**.

    ![Figure 11: Deploying Apps](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/select-image-2.jpg)

3. The deployment will be initiated, following which, you can close the screen as shown below.

    ![Figure 12: Triggered Deployment](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/deploy-app.jpg)

Once the deployment is successful, the pipelines will show `Succeeded`.

![Figure 13: Successful Deployment](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/successful.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Users need to have [Build and deploy permission](../user-guide/global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#role-based-access-levels) or above (along with access to the environment and applications) to initiate the deployment
{% endhint %}

## Additional Features

### Hibernating and Unhibernating Apps

Since every application comes with an option to hibernate, the same is true for application groups. Using application group, you can hibernate one or more applications belonging to the same environment if you do not want them to consume resources (replica count will be set to 0). 

In other words, you can hibernate running applications or unhibernate hibernated applications as per your requirement.

#### Hibernation Process

1. In the `Overview` page of your application group, use the checkboxes to choose the applications you wish to hibernate, and click the **Hibernate** button.

    ![Figure 14a: Selecting Apps to Hibernate](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/hibernate-apps.jpg)

2. Confirm the hibernation.

    ![Figure 14b: Confirming Hibernation](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/confirm-hibernation.jpg)

3. Hibernation will initiate as shown below. You may close the window. 

    ![Figure 14c: Initiation Status of Hibernation](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/initiated-hibernation.jpg)

Your applications pods would be scaled down and would stop incurring costs.

#### Unhibernation Process

1. In the same `Overview` page, you can use the checkboxes to choose the hibernated applications you wish to unhibernate, and click the **Unhibernate** button.

    ![Figure 15a: Selecting Hibernated Apps to Unhibernate](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/unhibernate-apps.jpg)

2. Confirm the unhibernation.

    ![Figure 15b: Confirming Unhibernation](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/confirm-unhibernation.jpg)

3. Unhibernation will initiate as shown below. You may close the window. 

    ![Figure 15c: Initiation Status of Unhibernation](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/initiated-unhibernation.jpg)

Your applications would be up and running in some time.

### Filtering Applications

Assume you have multiple applications (maybe 10, 50, 100, or more) showing up in an application group. If you want to limit your operations (build/deploy/other) to a specific set of applications, the filter feature will help you narrow down the list. Thus, you will see only those applications you select from the filter (be it on the `Overview` page, `Build & Deploy` page, and so on.)

1. Click the filter next to the application group as shown below.

    ![Figure 16: Filter Option](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-filter-1.jpg)

2. The filter will show all the applications present in the group. Click to select the relevant ones.

    ![Figure 17: All Apps](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-filter-2.jpg)

3. The filter narrows down the list of applications as shown below.

    ![Figure 18: Filtered Apps](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/app-filter-3.jpg)

4. (Optional) If required, you can save the filter for future use by clicking **Save selection as filter**.

    ![Figure 19: Saving a Filter](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/save-filter.jpg)

5. Add a name and description to the filter to help you know its purpose, and click **Save**.

    ![Figure 20: Naming a Filter](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/save-filter-2.jpg)

Now when you access the application group, your saved filter will be visible on top.

![Figure 21: Saved Filter](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/save-filter-3.jpg)

### Permissions

#### 1. Creating a filter

Users can create a filter if they have Admin/Manager access on all selected applications.

* **Case 1**: User has Admin/Manager access on all selected applications

    User will be able to create a filter with all selected applications.

* **Case 2**: User does not have Admin/Manager access on all selected applications

    User will not be able to create a filter.

* **Case 3**: User selected 4 applications but has Admin/Manager access for only 2 of them

    User should be able to create filter with these 2 applications.

#### 2. Editing a saved filter

Users can edit a saved filter if they have Admin/Manager access on all applications in the saved filter.

#### 3. Deleting a saved filter

Users can delete a saved filter if they have Admin/Manager access on all applications in the saved filter.

{% endhint %}


### Changing Branch

Assume you have a few applications whose [build pipelines](../reference/glossary.md#build-pipeline) fetch from the `main` branch of your code repository. However, you decided to maintain a `master` branch, and you want all the upcoming CI builds to consider the `master` branch as the source. Devtron provides you the option to change the branch at both levels—individual application as well as application group.

1. In the **Build & Deploy** tab of your application group, select the intended applications and click the **Change Branch** button present at the bottom.

    ![Figure 20: Changing Branch](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/change-branch.jpg)

2. Enter the new branch name. If your build pipeline has `Branch Regex` as the Source Type, you must ensure your new branch name matches the regex (regular expression) provided in that build pipeline. Once done, click **Update Branch**.

    ![Figure 21: Updating Branch Name](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/application-groups/update-branch.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Users need to have [Admin role](../user-guide/global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#role-based-access-levels) or above (along with access to the environment and applications) to update their branch
