# Devtron Integrations
 
Devtron integrations extend the functionality of your Devtron stack.

## Discover and install integrations
 
The current release of Devtron supports the Build and Deploy (CI/CD) integration. More integrations will be available soon; to request one, please [submit a ticket](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/issues/new/choose)

> Integrations can be installed by super admins; However other user roles can browse and request super admins to install the required integrations.

> Integrations are updated along with [Devtron updates](setup/../../setup/upgrade-devtron.md).

Select **Devtron Stack Manager** from the left navigation bar.
Under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Discover**.

> Although the integrations are installed separately, they cannot be upgraded separately. Integrations update happens automatically with [Devtron upgrade](#upgrade-devtron).
