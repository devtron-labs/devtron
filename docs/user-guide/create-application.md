## Tags

`Tags` are key-value pairs. You can add one or multiple tags in your application. 

**Propagate Tags** 
When tags are propagated, they are considered as labels to Kubernetes resources. Kubernetes offers integrated support for using these labels to query objects and perform bulk operations e.g., consolidated billing using labels. You can use these tags to filter/identify resources via CLI or in other Kubernetes tools.
