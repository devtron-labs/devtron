Job Pipelines that are set as automatic are always triggered as soon as a new commit is made to the git branch they're sensing. However, Job pipelines can always be manually triggered as and if required.

Various commits done in the repository can be seen here along with details like Author, Date etc. Select the commit that you want to trigger and then click on `Run Job` to trigger the job pipeline.

**Refresh** icon, refreshes Git Commits in the job Pipeline and fetches the latest commits from the `Git Repository`.

**Ignore Cache** : This option will ignore the previous build cache and create a fresh build. If selected, will take a longer build time than usual.

It can be seen that the job pipeline is triggered here and is the _Running_ state.
