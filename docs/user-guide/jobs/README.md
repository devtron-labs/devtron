# Jobs

Job allows manual and automated execution of your source code. Job pipeline will not have CI/CD pipeline as the job is limited to your source code only. You can also configure [preset plugins](../creating-application/workflow/ci-build-pre-post-plugins.md#preset-plugins) in your job pipeline.

With job, you can execute your source code quickly and easily without going through CI/CD pipelines, which also optimize time.

There are two main steps in executing Job:

* [Configurations](configuration-job.md)

* [Trigger Job](triggering-job.md)

In the next section, we will learn on how to create, configure, trigger a job. You can also view the details on the [Overview](overview-job.md) tab and `Run History`.
