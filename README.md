</details>
<details>
<summary> <b> Gitops aware  </b></summary>
<br>
 
- Gitops exposed through API and UI so that you dont have to interact with git cli
- Gitops backed by postgres for easier analysis
- Enforce finer access control than git

</details>
<details>
<summary> <b>Operational insights  </b></summary>
<br>
