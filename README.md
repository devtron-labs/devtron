## Why Devtron?
It is designed as a self-serve platform for operationalizing and maintaining applications (AppOps) on kubernetes in a developer friendly way. 


#### Some of the benefits  provided by devtron are: 
<br>

|Zero code software delivery workflow|
| ------------- |
| Workflow which understands the domain of kubernetes and testing so that you dont have to write scripts to handle it |
| Reusable and composable components so that workflows are easy to contruct and reason through |
<br>
<br>

| Multi cloud deployment |
| -----------------|
| Devtron allows multi deployment|
| Multi level security policy at global, cluster, environment and application for efficient hierarchical policy management |
<br>
<br>

| Easy dev-sec-ops integration |
| ---------------- |
| Deployment metrics to measure success of agile process. It captures mttr, change failure rate, deployment frequency, deployment size out of the box |
| Auto identify new and old pods |
| Auto identify new and old pods Auto identify new and old pods|
<br>
<br>

| Application debugging dashboard |
| ------------ |
| One place for all historical kubernetes events |
| Access all manifests securely for eg secret obfuscation |
| Auto identify new and old pods |
| **Application metrics** for cpu, ram, http status code and latency with comparison between new and old |
| **Advanced logging** with grep and json search |
| Intelligent **correlation between events, logs** for faster triangulation of issue |
| Auto issue identification |
<br>
<br>

| Enterprise Grade security and compliances |
| ----------- |
| Fine grained access control; control who can edit configuration and who can deploy. |
| Audit log to know who did what and when |
| History of all CI and CD events |
| Kubernetes events impacting application |
| Relevant cloud events and their impact on applications |
| Multi level security policy at global, cluster, environment and application for efficient hierarchical policy management |
| Behavior driven security policy |
| Define policies and exception for kubernetes resources |
| Define policies for events for faster resolution |
| Advanced workflow policies like blackout window, branch environment relationship to secure build and deployment pipelines |
<br>
<br>

| Gitops aware |
| --------------- |
| Gitops exposed through API and UI so that you dont have to interact with git cli |
| Gitops backed by postgres for easier analysis |
| Enforce finer access control than git |
<br>
<br>

| Operational insights |
| --------------- |
| Deployment metrics to measure success of agile process. It captures mttr, change failure rate, deployment frequency, deployment size out of the box. |
| Audit log to understand the failure causes |
| Monitor changes across deployments and revert easily |
