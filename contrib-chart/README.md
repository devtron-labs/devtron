# Bring Your Own Chart

We at Devtron strongly believe that a product is always incomplete without the contribution of it's community and the users. What else can be better than devtron users becoming a part of devtron team, the product they love and through this upcoming feature you can help other community members by sharing your own helm charts with devtron.

## Introduction

Very soon we are coming up with a new feature in the charts section of devtron which will be called `Community Charts` where we'll upload the charts submitted by you for all the users who love to deploy and build pipelines on devtron. **All of your charts will have your name associated with it for all users to know who made their life easier by uploading that chart**. So what are you waiting for? Now is the time to do that

## Use dynamic devtron variables in your template

Devtron injects [some variables](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/blob/main/contrib-chart/reference-chart_3-11-0/.image_descriptor_template.json) in values.yaml in order to fully integrate with automatic CD capability. In Template you can use these variables wherever required.

| Syntax | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| server.deployment.image | Image name to be used in Devtron CI/CD pipeline |
| server.deployment.image_tag | Image tag generated by Devtron CI/CD pipeline |
| pipelineName | Pipeline name used by Devtron for CI/CD |
| releaseVersion | Release version of the chart |
| deploymentType | Deployment strategy used for deployments by Devtron |
| app | App id to identify which app to use for CI/CD |
| env | Env name to identify in which environment to deploy |
| appMetrics | Configuration for the metrics exposed by the app |

## How to use dynamic devtron variables

This is an example of a deployment.yaml which takes values from [image descriptor template](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron/blob/main/contrib-chart/reference-chart_3-11-0/.image_descriptor_template.json)

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
        name: httpd-web
        labels:
            app: myweb
    spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
            matchLabels:
                app: myweb
        template:
            metadata:
                labels:
                    app: myweb
                    appId: {{ $.Values.app | quote }}
                    envId: {{ $.Values.env | quote }}
            spec:
                containers:
                - name: myweb-pod
                image: "{{ $.Values.server.deployment.image }}:{{ $.Values.server.deployment.image_tag }}"
                ports:
                - containerPort: 80


## How to Share Chart

1. Fork the [devtron-labs/devtron](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron) repository
2. Upload your chart directory inside `chart-contrib` directory
4. Add a README file inside your chart describing it's use case and how to use
5. Verify everything works fine by using the command `helm template --debug <template-dir-name>`
6. Generate a Pull Request on the branch `contribute-chart` of [devtron-labs/devtron](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron)
7. Hold on till we verify everything and upload on the community charts section
